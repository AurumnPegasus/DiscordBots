# DiscordBots
Set of Discord Bots I created to learn to make them effeciently :)

I have used javascript here because Discord.js is amazinggggg and I wanted to practice JS anyway :p

KickBan: A bot which kicks or bans user based on the users tagged. Watched a tutorial for it :p ;-; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BmKXBVdEV0g

rolebot: A bot which adds or removes specified roles from the user. Added dynamic help messages in it :)

tagbot: A bot which tags a user given number of times. Just for spams :p
